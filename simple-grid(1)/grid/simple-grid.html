    <h3>Dubai</h3>
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>With almost 200 different nationalities calling it home,
         and a massive 90% of the population coming from outside the country,
        Dubai is arguably one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world.
        In contrast to cities like New York or London that have been inhabited for hundreds of years,
        Dubaiâ€™s expats are mainly first-generation, bringing with them a host of different cultural traditions.
        The diversity on show in the city is unparalleled.</p>
